## About Koyeb and the Rails example application

Koyeb is a developer-friendly serverless platform to deploy apps globally. No-ops, servers, or infrastructure management.
This repository contains a Rails application you can deploy on the Koyeb serverless platform for testing.

This example application is designed to show how a Rails application can be deployed on Koyeb.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to deploy and run the Rails application on your Koyeb account.

### Requirements

You need a Koyeb account to successfully deploy and run this application. If you don't already have an account, you can sign-up for free [here](https://app.koyeb.com/auth/signup).

### Deploy using the Koyeb button

The fastest way to deploy the Rails application is to click the **Deploy to Koyeb** button below.

Clicking on this button brings you to the Koyeb App creation page with everything pre-set to launch this application.

_To modify this application example, you will need to fork this repository. Checkout the [fork and deploy](#fork-and-deploy-to-koyeb) instructions._

### Fork and deploy to Koyeb

If you want to customize and enhance this application, you need to fork this repository.

If you used the **Deploy to Koyeb** button, you can simply link your service to your forked repository to be able to push changes.
Alternatively, you can manually create the application as described below.

On the [Koyeb Control Panel](https://app.koyeb.com/), on the **Overview** tab, click the **Create Web Service** button to begin.

1. Select **GitHub** as the deployment method.
2. In the repositories list, select the repository you just forked.
3. Expand the **Builder** section.  Click the **override** toggle associated with the **Run command** and enter `rails server -b 0.0.0.0` in the field.
4. Choose a name for your App and Service, i.e `rails-on-koyeb`, and click **Deploy**.

You land on the deployment page where you can follow the build of your Rails application. Once the build is completed, your application is being deployed and you will be able to access it via `<YOUR_APP_NAME>-<YOUR_ORG_NAME>.koyeb.app`.
